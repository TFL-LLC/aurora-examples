## âœ… Guidelines

* Keep examples **simple and focused** (one main concept per file).
* Use clear, consistent naming:

  * `sample.ps1`, `sample.py`, `Sample.java`, etc.
* Add comments in the code to explain whatâ€™s happening.
* Donâ€™t commit secrets or API keys â€” use environment variables where needed.
* Make sure `.gitignore` rules keep out build artifacts, IDE settings, and other clutter.

---

## ðŸ›  Development Notes

* Line endings are normalized with `.gitattributes`.
* Temporary files and build outputs are excluded via `.gitignore`.
* All code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
